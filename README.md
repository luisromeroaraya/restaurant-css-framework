* Repository: **_restaurant-css-framework_**
* Duration: **4 day**
* Deadline: **02/02 - 17:00**
* Form: https://forms.gle/4F4u6QVLuCySSfTg7
* Team challenge: **solo**

## Missions objectives
At the end of this challenge you should have improved your:
* placement of element with **Bootstrap**

## The mission
Create a repository called *restaurant-css-framework* in which you must realise a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but the type of food (burger, pizza, asian, …) is your choice.

- [x] The website must be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

Welcome\
- [ ] A page with one *Jumbotron* and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…).

Menu\
- [ ] A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

Pictures\
- [ ] A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).

Restaurant\
- [ ] A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

Contact\
- [ ] A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.

*This is my first sketch:*
